## Mapping Exceptions WinFix
This simple command-line project is here to help contributors to the FHIR specification to be able to cleanup the line endings 
in the mapping-exceptions.xml files generated by the FHIR build process. The FHIR build process generates these files with
forced line endings, which causes issues when git checks these files out on Windows.

This project will convert the line endings to the standard line endings for the platform it is run on.

It is intended to be run after the FHIR build process has completed before committing any changes to git.
*(To help remove unintended changes due to inconsistent line endings)*

Usage:
```
c:\git\hl7\fhir-core-spec> mapping-exceptions-winfix
```

The tool will do nothing if it is run in a folder that does not contain a git repo with a parent of the FHIR source repo.
(https://github.com/HL7/fhir.git)
And only updates files that are already checked out in the local folder.
